# **Retail Strategy and Analytics – Quantium Virtual Internship**

## **Project Overview**
This project is part of the **Quantium Virtual Internship**, where I analyzed retail transaction data to derive insights into customer purchasing behavior and assess the impact of a targeted marketing trial. The project is divided into two tasks:  

- **Task 1: Customer Analytics**– Analyzed purchasing behavior, identified key customer segments, and examined the impact of affluence on spending habits.  
- **Task 2: Experiment Analysis** – Assessed the effectiveness of a marketing trial by comparing sales performance between trial and control stores.  
## **Jupyter Notebooks**
The full analysis, including data exploration, visualizations, and statistical testing, is available in the Jupyter Notebook files:

- [**Task 2: Experiment Analysis**](https://github.com/rohithmx11/Quantium-retail-analysis/blob/main/quantium_task2.ipynb)  

## **Key Objectives**
- **Customer Insights:** Understand consumer purchasing behavior based on affluence and lifestage.  
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Evaluate sales trends over time to identify peak periods.  
- **Trial Effectiveness:** Determine whether the marketing trial led to a significant increase in sales.  

## **Task 1: Customer Analytics**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on transaction data from July 2018 to June 2019.  
- Analyzed the impact of customer **affluence (Budget, Mainstream, Premium)** on chip purchases.  
- Identified key customer segments based on **lifestage (Young Singles/Couples, Retirees, Families, etc.)** to understand spending behavior.  

## **Task 2: Experiment Analysis**
- Selected suitable control stores for each trial store using **correlation analysis** and **scaling factors** to match pre-trial sales trends.  
- Compared sales between trial and control stores using **confidence intervals (CI) and statistical analysis** to determine significant differences.  
- Found that trial stores outperformed control stores in most cases, with some fluctuations in the third month of the trial.  

## **Presentation & Insights**
The final results were compiled into a **PowerPoint presentation**, summarizing the key findings through data visualizations and statistical interpretations.  

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL:** Used for querying structured data  
- **Power BI :** Data visualization (Presentation)
- **GitHub:** Version control and project documentation  


## **Conclusion**
This project provided hands-on experience in **customer analytics, statistical testing, and A/B testing methodologies** in a retail setting. The findings highlight the importance of **data-driven decision-making** in marketing strategy and performance evaluation.
